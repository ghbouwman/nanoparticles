maybe use k-nearest neighnours for graph generation
more rigorous understanding of electromigration: electron density
use wavelet transform on data
breakaway energy
what is the temperature at which the experiment takes place?
get data from Julien


for report:
talk about the solver as a bottleneck and the use of a good first guess from the previous timestep as an improvement
