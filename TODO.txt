more rigorous understanding of electromigration: electron density
use wavelet transform on data
breakaway energy
what is the temperature at which the experiment takes place?
get data from Julien
put some mkdirs in install.sh
add animation

add molar mass of molybdenum
what are the charge and effective valence of Mo ions?

for report:
talk about the solver as a bottleneck and the use of a good first guess from the previous timestep as an improvement
